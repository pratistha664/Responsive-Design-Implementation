## Description
For my second internship task, I designed a responsive e-commerce product page focused on selling shoes, inspired by platforms like Flipkart. This task was executed entirely using Figma, a collaborative design tool, without any code implementation.

The goal was to conceptualize and visually structure a clean, intuitive, and conversion-friendly product page that includes the essential elements of a modern online shopping experience.

Design Overview

The page starts with a top navigation bar that resembles a standard e-commerce layout. Although minimal, the navbar is structured to support brand placement, navigation links, and user access points such as login or cart in a future iteration.

Immediately after the navbar, a search bar is placed prominently. The intention here is to mimic user behavior on real platforms like Flipkart, where product discovery is a core feature. The search bar is large and centered for easy accessibility, especially on mobile devices.

Below the search bar, the main product showcase begins. The focus of the page is a high-quality shoe image, which represents the product being sold. I selected or inserted a visually clean shoe image to give users a clear view of what they are purchasng. The image is centered within a clean frame and is given enough spacing to keep the layout breathable.

Accompanying the shoe image is its price, clearly displayed in a readable font and bold style. This allows users to quickly grasp the product's value without scrolling or confusion. The pricing section is kept close to the image for easy visual scanning and user decision-making.

Next, I added two key call-to-action buttons:

Add to Cart

Buy Now


These buttons are designed using Figma components and styled with bold colors to stand out. The Add to Cart button allows users to store the item for later, while the Buy Now button suggests a quicker path to checkout. The size, color contrast, and placement of these buttons follow UI/UX best practices to ensure high usability and conversion potential.

Design Approach

All design elements were carefully aligned using Figma’s layout tools to maintain visual consistency across screen sizes. Although this task was not developed with code, I kept responsive design principles in mind — planning the layout so it could be easily adapted for mobile and tablet views in the future.

I used Figma’s image placement tools to ensure all visuals were sharp and scalable. Buttons and price tags were styled using standard design conventions for e-commerce to simulate a real product detail page.

Conclusion

This design demonstrates my ability to analyze a real-world platform (Flipkart), extract key user interface elements, and recreate a meaningful UI/UX experience from scratch using Figma. This task helped me improve my skills in layout design, user flow, and component-based thinking in UI design.i
